- Binary feature: Age (35y.o), BS (8 mmol/L)

- polynomial features such as square, cubic, or higher-order polynomial terms. This approach captures the curve relationship between age and the risk level, rather than assuming a simple linear relationship.

- feature interaction: create new features that are combinations of existing features, such as age*BS or age*BodyTemp.

- Sum of squares attributes
