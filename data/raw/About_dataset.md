This data science project aimed at using the power of data science and machine learning to enhance the prenatal care and well-being of pregnant women. It seeks to develop a predictive model that can assess the risk factors associated with pregnancy.

The data for this project was taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csafrit2/maternal-health-risk-data). It has been collected from different hospitals, community clinics, maternal health cares through the IoT based risk monitoring system.

Columns in the dataset:

    Age: Age in years when a woman is pregnant.
    SystolicBP: Upper value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, another significant attribute during pregnancy.
    DiastolicBP: Lower value of Blood Pressure in mmHg, another significant attribute during pregnancy.
    BS: Blood glucose levels is in terms of a molar concentration, mmol/L.
    HeartRate: A normal resting heart rate in beats per minute.
    Risk Level: Predicted Risk Intensity Level during pregnancy considering the previous attribute.


血压：根据《中国高血压防治指南(2018年修订版)》，我国成年人血压的正常范围为收缩压小于120mmHg，舒张压小于80mmHg 


血糖：根据《中国2型糖尿病防治指南（2017版）》，正常血糖值为空腹血糖小于6.1mmol/L，餐后2小时血糖小于7.8mmol/L 
。另一方面，血糖波动过大可能带来危害，正常情况下血糖波动若超过2.2mmol/L可能表示波动范围异常，如果一天内7次血糖测量的最高值与最低值之差大于4.4mmol/L，说明血糖波动剧烈 


正常体温范围：
    摄氏度：大约在36.1°C 到 37.2°C之间。
    华氏度：大约在97°F 到 99°F之间。


心率：世界卫生组织的标准认为正常成人的心率正常值为60~100次/分
